# Divide and Conquer

Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic pattern. In algorithmic methods, the design is to take a dispute on a huge input, break the input into minor pieces, decide the problem on each of the small pieces, and then merge the piecewise solutions into a global solution. This mechanism of solving the problem is called the Divide & Conquer Strategy.

Divide and Conquer algorithm consists of a dispute using the following three steps.

1. **Divide** the original problem into a set of subproblems.

2. **Conquer:** Solve every subproblem individually, recursively.

3. **Combine:** Put together the solutions of the subproblems to get the solution to the whole problem.
