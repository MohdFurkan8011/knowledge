# Object pool

Object pool pattern is a software creational design pattern which is used in situations where the cost of initializing a class instance is very high.
Basically, an Object pool is a container which contains some amount of objects. So, when an object is taken from the pool, it is not available in the pool until it is put back.
Objects in the pool have a lifecycle:

- Creation
- Validation
- Destroy
