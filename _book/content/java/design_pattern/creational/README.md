# Creational

Creational design patterns are concerned with **the way of creating objects.** These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class).

But everyone knows an object is created by using new keyword in java. For example:

```java
StudentRecord s1 = new StudentRecord();
```
