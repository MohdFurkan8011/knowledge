# Collection

A Collection is a group of individual objects represented as a single unit. Java provides Collection Framework which defines several classes and interfaces to represent a group of objects as a single unit.

The Collection interface (**java.util.Collection**) and Map interface (**java.util.Map**) are the two main “root” interfaces of Java collection classes.

**Need for Collection Framework :**
Before Collection Framework (or before JDK 1.2) was introduced, the standard methods for grouping Java objects (or collections) were Arrays or Vectors or Hashtables. All of these collections had no common interface.
