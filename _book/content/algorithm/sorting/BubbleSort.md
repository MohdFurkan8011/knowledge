# Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of Ο(n2) where **n** is the number of items.

```java
void bubble_sort( int A[ ], int n ) {
    int temp;
    for(int k = 0; k< n-1; k++) {
        // (n-k-1) is for ignoring comparisons of elements which have already been 
        // compared in earlier iterations
        for(int i = 0; i < n-k-1; i++) {
            if(A[ i ] > A[ i+1] ) {
                // here swapping of positions is being done.
                temp = A[ i ];
                A[ i ] = A[ i+1 ];
                A[ i + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
