# Stack

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) 

**Ex.** Function call stack is a good example of a stack.

**Operation**

1. push() : adds a single element at the top of the stack.
2. pop(): removes a single element from the top of the stack.
3. top(): reads the value of the top element of the stack.
4. isEmpty(): returns true if stack is empty
5. size(): returns the number of the elements in the stack.



#### Stack Implementation

1. Using  array
2. In C, using dynamic memory allocation
3. In java, Using Stack class
4. Stack using linked list



### Problems in Stack

1. Sorted insert
2. Sort stack
3. Bottom insert
4. Reverse stack
5. Reverse k element in a stack
6. Max Depth Parenthesis
7. Longest Continuous balanced parenthesis
8. Reverse parenthesis
9. Infix expression, prefix expression, postfix expression
